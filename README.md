# MyCodes
All my codes here :)
# Disclaimer
* All my codes have been translated partly by me and partly by the translator named "Deep-L" so there may be translation errors :)
### Here you can find all my realised codes. Some of them have more documentation than others. I will always try to improve the codes, so I accept all kinds of positive and negative criticism :D.
# What will you find here?.
* In the first case, as the name of the repository suggests, you will find all my code.
# What kind of codes are there?.
* I intend to upload all the codes either for school work or personal work, and I will also upload tests of new things I learn.
## Be welcome to my repository I hope some of these codes will help you :D.
> If you find any bug or problem with my code feel free to post it in the 'issues' section
