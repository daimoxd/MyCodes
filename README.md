# MyCodes
All my codes here :)
### Here you will find all my realized codes. Some with more documentation than others. I will always try to improve the codes, so I accept all kind of positive and negative critics :D.
# What will you find here?.
* In the first case, as it is evident from the name of the repository you will find all my codes
# What kind of codes are there?.
* I intend to upload all the codes either for school work or personal work and I will also upload tests of new things I will learn.
